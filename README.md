This is the UI part of the [`reptile` shared REPL](https://github.com/raymcdermott/reptile-body). You use is to enter forms and see the results of evaluation. You can also watch your friends editing in real-time and share their REPL evaluations.

The technical implementation is a [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) based Single Page Application (SPA).

## Development

### Running with a REPL:

```
clojure -A:fig:repl:body:body-path
```

### Run application on the command line:

```
clojure -A:fig:dev:body:body-path
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:9500](http://localhost:9500).

The REPtiLe server will be started in the background so there is no need to start a separate server in the development process.

## Configuration

The location of the back-end server is configurable.

The name of the server can be set in the `min.cljs.edn` by changing `reptile.tongue.config/TAIL_SERVER`

Please also checkout the [REPtiLE configuration](https://github.com/raymcdermott/reptile-tail) options

## Local deps.edn configuration

Add some entries to the `aliases` section of `~/.clojure/deps.edn` similar to these:

```clojure
:aliases {
  :body/local {:override-deps {reptile-body {:local/root "/Users/your-name/dev/reptile-house/body"}}}
  :body/path {:extra-paths ["/Users/your-name/dev/reptile-house/body/dev"]}
}
```

And then run it from the command line:

```
clj -A:fig:dev:body/local:body/path
```

## Production Build

```
clojure -A:fig:min
```

#### AWS S3 hosting

AWS S3 buckets can be configured to host web sites and thus be used to serve the UI.

The `s3-publish.sh` script is provided for building the code and syncing with an S3 bucket. 

The script will also invalidate any configured CloudFront distribution.
